## Predictive Logistic and Allocation for Eco-friendly Transport

## Summary
PLANET aims to optimize the global distribution of spare parts for business aviation by predicting aircraft movements. Using AI-driven forecasting based on flight history, weather conditions, and major global events, the project seeks to reduce unnecessary transport, minimize costs, and lower the aviation industry's carbon footprint. By ensuring that spare parts are available where they are needed, PLANET contributes to more efficient and sustainable logistics in business aviation.

## Background
The rapid availability of spare parts is crucial for business aircraft maintenance, but their global distribution presents a logistical challenge. Poor stock management can lead to extended delays and high costs, as well as unnecessary emissions due to inefficient logistics and emergency shipments.

Problems encountered:
* Inaccurate forecasting of spare parts needs
* High logistics costs due to inefficient stock distribution
* Aircraft downtime caused by unavailable parts
* Increased carbon footprint due to excessive and unoptimized transport of spare parts

The goal of this project is to optimize the distribution of spare parts by predicting the future position of business jets. This optimization will be based on flight history, weather conditions, and major global events likely to attract private jet owners (sporting events, international summits, etc.). By reducing unnecessary transportation and ensuring parts are available where they are needed, this project aims to decrease emissions and contribute to a more sustainable aviation industry.

## How is it used?
The predictive system analyzes multiple data sources to estimate the future location of business aircraft. It enables maintenance companies and parts suppliers to adjust their inventory proactively, reducing the need for last-minute, high-emission transport solutions.

1. Data collection and analysis:
   - Flight history
   - Weather conditions
   - Global event calendar
2. Modeling and forecasting aircraft movements
3. Optimizing spare parts stock distribution to reduce emissions

Main users:
* Business aviation companies
* Aircraft maintenance providers
* Spare parts suppliers
* Sustainability-focused aviation organizations

## Data sources and AI methods
The data used will come from various public and private sources:
* [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) for flight history
* Meteorological sources (e.g., NOAA, METAR)
* International event databases

Planned AI methods:
* Unsupervised learning to identify groups of aircraft with similar behaviors
* Supervised learning to refine predictions of future positions
* Optimization algorithms to minimize logistics-related emissions


## Challenges
* Reliability of data sources and real-time accessibility
* Complexity of forecasting models requiring fine-tuning
* Ethical and regulatory considerations regarding flight data usage
* Balancing supply chain efficiency with sustainability goals

## What next?
Next steps include:
* Testing and comparing supervised and unsupervised models
* Integration of real-time data
* Deployment of a user interface for spare parts suppliers
* Refinement of emissions reduction calculations
* Partnerships with sustainable aviation initiatives

Skills and assistance needed:
* Expertise in machine learning applied to trajectory prediction
* Access to flight and event databases
* Collaboration with aircraft maintenance stakeholders
* Input from sustainability experts on carbon footprint reduction
